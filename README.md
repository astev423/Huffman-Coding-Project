# Huffman-Coding-Project
Write tests FOR EACH LITTLE THING!!! TEST EVERYTHING!!!!

-Write tests in binary for decompression, tests with minheap vectors for deserialization/serialization. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS BEFORE MOVING ONTO THE NEXT THING!


# How to run/test
In the terminal type
```
Make
```
and then
```
./HuffmanCoder
```
The terminal output from the program will explain the rest. Just make sure you have a .txt file ready.

# Notes on the project
-I wanted to learn how to use smart pointers, which I think I did successfully, but they were
definitely a challenge

-Writing tests helps a lot. Test every little thing. I get anxious when building a large piece
of code without testing, because if something goes wrong you have to search a giant file to find
it, massive headache. Instead build small components, test each one, then build bigger components
with those.
